#### Notes on Linear Regression:
  - Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  - It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and uses a line of best fit to predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables.
  - The equation for linear regression is y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.
  - Linear regression can be used for both prediction and inference, and it is a fundamental tool in data analysis and machine learning.

Ways to find the error term:
- SSE (Sum of Squared Errors):
  - SSE = Σ(y<sub>i</sub> - (ŷ<sub>i</sub>))<sup>2</sup>
- MSE (Mean Squared Error):
  - MSE = SSE / n
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):
  - RMSE = √MSE
